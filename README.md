# Polya Urn simulation of Proof of stake reward mechanism

&copy; Maxence Raballand 2021

This is a simulation of the Proof of stake rewarding system with python using the Polya Urn model.

This work was done for my study in progress on the security of Proof of stake blockchains and here especially on the concentration of wealth with compounding.
